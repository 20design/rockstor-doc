What is Rockstor?
-----------------

Rockstor is a **free enterprise class file storage platform**. At the
foundation, it is a Fedora 19 flavored Linux operating system tailored for
storage usecases. The primary supported usecase is NAS via protocols including
NFS, Samba/CIFS and SFTP. Rockstor brings together technologies including the
Linux kernel, BTRFS filesystem, SystemTap and our own free software stack to
deliver a compelling solution.

Does Rockstor provide Block or Object storage?
----------------------------------------------

Not currently. File storage is the only supported usecase. Block storage
support can be added and we shall consider it based on demand, but Object
storage is not on the idea board. However, Rockstor is Free Software and anyone
in the community is welcome to add these features.

How is Rockstor different from other software NAS products?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Just like other NAS products, Rockstor supports file storage via popular
protocols(NFS, Samba/CIFS, SFTP). With the exception of that broad similarity,
there are many differences. Rockstor runs on Linux kernel and uses BTRFS as the
underlying filesystem. It makes storage management easy with smart features and
a powerful UI. It exposes a robust API to be used as a high performance storage
backend in Cloud infrastructures. These are just a few differences. Give
Rockstor a try and you'll notice the value and differentiation right away.

Who can download and use Rockstor?
----------------------------------

All Y'all. Rockstor is a open source project with the primary goal to ensure
that it's freely available for anyone to use and that it provides value and
quality to all of it's users. A lot of effort goes into developing Rockstor and
we'd love for it to be widely used and distributed.

How much does Rockstor cost?
----------------------------

$0.00 USD. Rockstor is not Open Storage, Open Core or some other bottom line
driven partially open thing. It is completely Free and Open Source and is here
to stay that way. You can use the product in it's entirity for free of cost and
explore :ref:`freesupport`. :ref:`Commercial support` is also available and if you so
choose, you can even hire us to build stuff with Rockstor.


How can I get started with Rockstor?
------------------------------------

Installation of Rockstor is a very easy and short process. You can even install
it on a old server or check it out on AWS cloud. See :ref:`quickstartguide` to
get started.

What kind of hardware do I need to install Rockstor?
----------------------------------------------------

Rockstor run on 64-bit commodity hardware. At the least, you can run it as a VM
or install it on a old server. See :ref:`quickstartguide` for more information.


What is a quick way to evaluate Rockstor?
-----------------------------------------

For quick evaluation, install Rockstor on Virtual Box, VMWare or try it out on
AWS Cloud. See :ref:`quickeval` for more information.


Do you have any hardware recommendations?
-----------------------------------------

For individual or small business use, we've seen Rockstor install flawlessly on
HP, DELL and supermicro desktops and small servers. The developers of Rockstor
use HP Micro servers for individual use.

Rockstor also installs smoothly on latest generation servers from vendors like
HP and Supermicro.


Is rockstor ready for production use?
-------------------------------------

While some features of Rockstor are ready for primetime, as a whole, it is
currently in Beta. However, the product has been downloaded by many and we have
direct knowledge of a handful of deployments. The developers of Rockstor use it
heavily and continue to test all layers of Rockstor software.

Who is using Rockstor?
----------------------

We see regular downloads of the product, but it's hard to say who is actively
using the product as we don't collect that information. It is suitable for
small to midsize businesses and of course for advanced individual users. We are
familiar with deployments storing up to 200 GB of data on Rockstor.

I have Rockstor installed. How do I get software updates?
---------------------------------------------------------

Rockstor development happens at a reasonably fast pace. At this time, we are
only releasing production updates once a month or so. Rockstor should be
updated directly from the web-ui when it indicates that an update is
available. It's a simple process and takes couple of mouse clicks and a few minutes.

How is Rockstor licensed?
-------------------------

Rockstor is free software licenced under the terms of GNU General Public
License version 2. See here for more details.


 What Linux flavor is rockstor based on?
---------------------------------------

Rockstor is based on Fedora 19.

-------------------------------------------

Rockstor only supports BTRFS filesystem. See here for more details.

How do I protect data loss with Rockstor?
-----------------------------------------

Disk level redundancy is provided by builtin software raid of BTRFS including
raid1, raid10, raid5 and raid6. Beyond that, Rockstor also supports replication
of Shares across two or more Rockstor appliances.

 Can I use Rockstor with other Storage products?
-----------------------------------------------

This question is a bit ambiguous. All that Rockstor needs in terms of storage
resources is a set of disk drives. These drives can be physical, virtual,
direct attached or can come from SAN.

Rockstor also comes with a backup plugin, making it a suitable backup target to
replicate data from expensive NAS products.

Possibly. Contact us with your requirements and we will get in touch with you.
