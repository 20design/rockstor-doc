What is Rockstor?
-----------------

Rockstor is a **free enterprise class file storage platform**. At the
foundation, it is a CentOS flavored Linux operating system tailored for storage
usecases. Specifically, it addresses NAS usecase. Rockstor brings together
technologies including the Linux kernel, BTRFS filesystem, SystemTap and our
own free software stack to deliver a compelling solution.

How can I get started with Rockstor?
------------------------------------

See :ref:`quickstartguide` to get started. It's a very easy and short
installation process.

What is a quick way to evaluate Rockstor?
-----------------------------------------

There are two quick ways to evaluate Rockstor. See :ref:`quickeval` for more information.

Is rockstor ready for production use?
-------------------------------------

While some features of Rockstor are ready for primetime, as a whole, it is
currently in Beta and not suitable for production use. However, we have
multiple installations of Rockstor that have been stable and we continue to
test all layers of Rockstor software. We plan to finalize the Linux kernel
version soon, perhaps with the next version of CentOS release at which point we
will reevaluate Rockstor's suitability for production use.

What enterprize linux flavor is rockstor based on?
--------------------------------------------------

Rockstor is based on CentOS 6.3. However, it runs mainline kernel version
3.7.7-1.

Can I use Rockstor with other Storage products?
-----------------------------------------------

This question is a bit ambiguous. All that Rockstor needs in terms of storage
resources is a set of disk drives. These drives can be physical, virtual,
direct attached or can come from SAN. Beyond the disk drive layer, Rockstor
cannot be used with other Storage products. At least, not currently.
