usecases. Specifically, it addresses NAS usecase. Rockstor brings together
technologies including the Linux kernel, BTRFS filesystem, SystemTap and our
own free software stack to deliver a compelling solution.

installation process.

Is rockstor ready for production use?
-------------------------------------

Rockstor is currently in Beta and not suitable for production use. However, we
have multiple installations of Rockstor that have been stable and we continue
to test all layers of Rockstor software. We plan to finalize the Linux kernel
soon, perhaps with the next version of CentOS release at which point we will
reevaluate Rockstor's suitability for production use.

What enterprize linux flavor is rockstor based on?
--------------------------------------------------

Rockstor is based on CentOS 6.3. However, it runs mainline kernel version
3.7.7-1.

Can I use Rockstor with other Storage products?
-----------------------------------------------

This means question means different to different people. All that Rockstor
needs in terms of storage resources is a set of disk drives. These drives can
be physical, virtual, direct attached or can come from SAN. Beyond the disk
drive layer, Rockstor cannot be used with other Storage products. At least, not
currently.
