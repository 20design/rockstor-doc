Installation
============

Installation of Rockstor is a short and straight forward process. For all types
of installations, see :ref:`quickstartguide` to get started.

Hardware recommendations:
-------------------------

At the bare minimum, see :ref:`minsysreqs` for a basic recommendation. This
translates to most commodity servers with more than a couple of disk
drives. Based on your cost constraints and performance requirements, several
hardware configurations are possible as described below.

Upgrading Rockstor
------------------

Rockstor is under continuous development. However, we strive to make most
updates non-disruptive. You can safely update Rockstor anytime with the
following command::

    [root@localhost ~]# yum update rockstor

If an update is disruptive, the update process prompts for user action and
provides the necessary information to choose to update or not. You can safely
decide not to update if that makes sense for your environment.


Installation in a virtual environment

Quick evaluation
------------------

Before proceeding with a serious installation that may require hardware
procurement, you can evaluate Rockstor on Amazon AWS. `Here

started.

Rockstor can also be evaluated quickly using Virtualbox. `Here
