Manage multiple Rockstor appliances
===================================

Rockstor provides a simple way to manage multiple appliances. The webui is
designed to manage a single appliance at once. However, switching between
webuis of multiple appliances is easy. In addition, appliances can be made
aware of each other.

Add a new Rockstor appliance
----------------------------

Suppose there are two Rockstor appliances that are fully setup. Their webuis
can be accessed individually as expected. However, for convenience, the second
appliance can be added to the first's configuration. In the top left corner of
the webui under the logo is the ip address of the appliance. Click on it and
the Appliances popup window will open. Now click on the **Add Appliance**
button and submit the form as shown below.

From the Appliances popup, clicking on an appliance's ip will open it's
webui. Besides the convenience, adding an appliance is necessary inorder to
replicate shares to it.
