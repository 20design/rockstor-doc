User Interfaces
===============
Rockstor supports 2 main user interface methods.

1. a browser based interface (web-ui)
2. a RESTful API that enables complete programmatic control

.. _webui:

web-ui
------

The RockStor browser based interface or web-ui is supported on the Firefox
web browser.

The initial setup of the appliance should be done through the
web-ui, and once it is completed, any interface method can be used; including ssh bash access if required.

.. _setup:

Setup
^^^^^

Once Rockstor installation is finished, as described in the
:ref:`installation` section, the new appliance can be setup by visiting
https://<appliance_ip> in your browser.

The setup process consists of two screens. In the first screen, an admin user
must be created by entering desired credentials. In the second screen, all
disks detected in the system are displayed. Click next to finish the setup
process as shown below.

Once the setup process is complete, the newly created admin user is logged in
and the Rockstor dashboard is displayed.
