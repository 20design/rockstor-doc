Support
=======

It's our mission to provide Rockstor's customers with the best support
possible. We understand that support needs vary between organizations. So our
support channels are setup to meet different expectations. There are a few
avenues to get free support if you don't want to pay for it. We try our best to
provide free support subject to time and resource constraints. For more
accountability and reliability, consider a paid support contract. Below are all
avenues of support you can choose from.

Ask a question
--------------

We embrace the spirit of Free and Open source software at Rockstor. So,
feedback and participation from the user community is very valuable. The
quickest way to ask a question is via `rockstor-devel
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rockstor-devel>`_ mailing list.

All of Rockstor's documentation, howtos, FAQs and knowledgebase is searchable
